                    <h3> I'm terrible at introducing myself. </h3>
                    <p> To summarize, I'm somewhat of a complicated, depressed and weird guy. Let's list some facts about myself: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="simple-li"> I'm a highly gifted Brazilian high school student. </li>
                        <li class="simple-li"> I can't socialize, but since I'm not ugly and somewhat intelligent, people tend to like me. Not only that, but I hate to have conversations with most of the people, so I spend most of my time alone. </li>
                        <li class="simple-li"> I used to be always jumping from one relationship to another, and I always hurt myself. Now I'm done with all this stuff. </li>
                        <li class="simple-li"> I love my friends with the deepest part of my heart. </li>
                        <li class="simple-li"> I also love Muay Thai and UFC in general. </li>
                        <li class="simple-li"> I have many things to list, but I don't want this page to be big. </li>
                    <br>
                    <p> I believe that someone can be described by the things that he/she loves, so here are some things I'm in love right now. </p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li> <b> Quantum Computing </b> <br><br> Although I'm in high school, I participate in a research group in a local university that studies quantum computing and neural networks, It's a tuff love, but I truly feel it on the deepest part of my heart, I have trouble with deadlines but I (almost) always make everything in time! </li>
                        <li> <b> Physics and Mathematics </b> <br><br> I'm boring, I love physics and math. I'm currently studying deeper into quantum mechanics and linear algebra because of my college research, but before that I used to be highly interested in classical mechanics and it's math language, the laws of the observable universe! </li>
                        <li> <b> Programming, Robotics, game+app development </b> <br><br> Well, of course I like programming, when I was 9 years old I started learning python and html and never stopped. Today I know more than 8 programming languages. ("fluently": python, C, C++, go and C#.) Programming is my main passion, but I don't have as much time as I would want to. I hope to develop more side projects now in 2023! (Specially games) And, I too love playing with arduinos, raspberry pi's and automation in general, I even competed and won some national robotics competitions here in Brazil. </li>
                        <li> <b> Worldwide Religions </b> <br><br> Since I was a little kid, I loved to study different religions, I started with Christianity because of my family, today I have studied Christianity, Hinduism, Judaism, Buddhism, Taoism and others. Now I'm reading deeper into Hinduism and Islamic religion. </li>
                        <li> <b> Philosophy </b> <br><br> I always loved philosophy, as a kid I started with its Greek origins, and since then I never stopped reading and writing. I'm currently reading the works of Wittgenstein and Heidegger. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p align="center"> This is getting too boring already, sorry for that.</p>
                    <p align="center"> I hope this page is readable.</p>
