                    <li> (music) - ??/??/2022 <br><br> I've been waking up with this song playing in my head - <a href="https://youtu.be/ChuSddfohxo?list=RDDSK2ER81b48"> November - Psychedelic Porn Crumpets</a> </li>
                    <li> (music) - ??/??/2022 <br><br> Now I just want you to know that if don't know the band up above, you're a war criminal, check this song - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUgtf47opj4"> Cubensis Lenses - Psychedelic Porn Crumpets</a>
		            <li> (music) - ??/??/2022 <br><br> The past few days I've been learning to play this song, I like how good I feel when listening/playing it - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-59rmRj4QnA"> My Sweet Lord - George Harrison </a> </li>
                    <li> (notes) - 05/12/2022 <br><br> In these past few days I've been doing the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2022">Advent of Code</a> code challange, It's great and I totally recommend it. <a href="https://github.com/pchagas-cloud/advent-of-code"> Here are my answers for the 2022 and 2021 challange. </a> </li>
                    <li> (notes) - 14/12/2022 <br><br> These past few days I've been feeling quite sad, maybe overwhelmed with my current "social cicle", I feel like god brought to me a beatiful oportunity, and I'm throwing it away, throwing everything away, sorry God, maybe I'm not ready to your blessings.</li>
                    <li> (notes) - 18/12/2022 <br><br> Depression is hitting really hard this december, some stuff happened in my personal life and I honestly don't want to write about it, I just want to forget. I don't feel like waking up anymore, I don't get happy doing programming, I'm just really fucking sad, but glad I don't want to die like in the past. </li>
                    <li> (notes) - 20/12/2022 <br><br> I'm thinking about creating a nodejs script for adding stuff to the website pages. If I do so it could be quite useful for other people, <a href="https://github.com/pchagas72/my-website">here is the website github repo.</a> It would also be a way to try fighting depression, better than medicines.</li>
                    <li> (notes) - 09/01/2023 <br><br> Happy new year for everyone, I know it's late. I spent most of the new years eve alone, sleeping, I can't really communicate with my family, just with my mother. People I love sent me a happy new year message, it made me really happy! I don't feel better right now, but I do have some hope and I will try to live better in 2023 than I did in 2022. </li>
                    <li> (music) - 09/01/2023 <br><br> Here is a good song I'm listening right now: <a href="https://youtu.be/ulOgzjdBdzY?list=RDjEX0r9cs5_0"> I Didn't Know - Skinshape </a>
                    <li> (important note) - 09/01/2023 <br><br> Borzoi's are my favourite dog breed now! They are so cute, I love all of them (I guess...) <br><br> <img src="sources/borzoi.png" width="400"> <br> Image of a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/eriszoi/">happy girl! </a> </li>
                    <li> (notes) - 10/01/2023 <br><br> Depression is fucking horrible, I started many programming projects since my vacation began, but some personal stuff happened in my life that made me kinda miserable... I can't find any reason to wake up before 12PM, or to sleep before 5AM, stuff that used to make me happy just dont now. (fuck writing a correct english btw.) I don't think about killing myself anymore, thats a good thing, but why do I feel so empty? why do nothing makes any fucking sense? why do I keep having panic attacks alone in my house? why the fuck am I so weird. And to make thing worse, people expect good things from me since I'm """intelligent/gifted""". I can't have fun like my friends, just playing games or watching movies/series, I get borred, but the things that I love to do just don't make sense anymore, I feel like a failure, sorry God. </li>
                    <li> (notes) - 16/01/2023 <br><br> Just for a quick update, I'm feeling a lot better now than I was in my last post. For 4~5 days, I trained 5 hours per day of muay thai! I feel a whle lot better doing this. <br>
                    One other thing, I always write stuff in this website late at night, now it's 01:30 in the morning, but the majority of the notes were written at like, 4~5AM. <br>
                    And I want to write about good things here too! Not just the bad stuff y'know, I'll improve on that. I'll try to write weekly reports for my projects.</li>
