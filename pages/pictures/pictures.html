	    <p>I went to Rio de Janeiro, the views were great and the weather was nice. But because of this trip my favourite person in the world now does not care about me anymore, she hated me for a while but now, according to her, she forgot me and I need to do the same. I wanted to kill myself, and I harmed myself because of that. I wish that I never went on that trip. I'm fucking devastated and I can't do anything without thinking about her. Everything that happened was a fucking giant mistake of mine, and also a misunderstand. I wanted to kill myself and life without you is simply not the same. I miss you.</p>
