	      <h3> The biggest question of the world is "who am I" </h3>
	      <p>In reality I don't think that nobody really knows these days. <br> My name is Pedro, I'm a 17 y.o highschooler who likes computers, linux, FOSS and stuff of this kind. </p>
	      <h3> In reality, I don't know who I am. </h3>
	      <p>I have some problems that led me to being somewhat weird socially, so I enjoy most of my time on my computer.</p>
	      <p>I update this site only when something bad happens and I get real sad, this time I'm in real bad terms with my best friend/lover/girlfriend/IDK, and it's all my fault, I don't think she wants to talk to me ever again.</p>
	      <h3> But everything always tends to end up just fine. </h3>

	  <h3> A journey on learning myself </h3>
	  <p>I've been going to a therapist for quite a while now, she tells me that I never was truly myself. I don't have all the answers to my problems, but she convinced me that at least this is true.</p>
	  <h3> This is <u>my place</u>. </h3>
	  <p>This website has always been a place in which I just do whatever comes to mind, so I thought that this is my place, something that is truly like me.</p>
	  <h3> My weird corner of the internet </h3>
	  <p> Someday I hope to be able to turn this website into something I like. Someday I hope to show my weirdness to the world in a good way, I want to do what I love and be happy, I pray to God, so this can become true. </p>
