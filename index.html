	      <p>In reality I don't think that nobody can. <br> My name is Pedro, I'm a 17 y.o highschooler who likes computers, linux, programming and stuff of this kind. But I also love physics, mathematics, philosophy, religions... Many things.</p>
	      <h3> In reality, I don't know who I am. </h3>
	      <p>I have some problems that led me to being somewhat weird socially, so I enjoy most of my time on my computer.</p>
	      <p>I update this site only when something bad happens and I get real sad, this time I'm in real bad terms with my best friend/lover/girlfriend/IDK, and it's all my fault, I don't think she wants to talk to me ever again.</p

		<h3> I want to be more like myself. </h3>
		<p>I've been going to a therapist for quite a while now, and she tells me that I have never been truly happy, because I was never truly myself. I don't have all the answers to my problems, but she convinced me that at least this is true.</p>
		<h3> This is <u>my place</u>. </h3>
		<p>This website has always been a place in which I just do whatever comes to mind, so I thought that this is my place, something that is truly like me.</p>
		<h3> My weird corner of the internet </h3>
		<p> Someday I hope to be able to turn this website into something I like, it will mean the world to me. Someday I hope to show my weirdness to the world in a good way, I want to do what I love and be happy, I pray to God, so this dream can become true. </p>
